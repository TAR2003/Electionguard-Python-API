    Service function to setup guardians and create joint key with complete backup key sharing.
    
    This implements the ElectionGuard Backup Key Share Generation and Distribution Process:
    1. Each guardian generates their private key, public key, and secret polynomial
    2. Each guardian evaluates their polynomial at other guardians' identifier points
    3. Each guardian encrypts backup shares using recipients' auxiliary public keys
    4. The mediator (server) distributes encrypted shares to designated recipients
    5. Recipients decrypt and verify shares using mathematical proofs

        number_of_guardians: Number of guardians to create
        quorum: Minimum number of guardians needed for decryption
        party_names: List of party names
